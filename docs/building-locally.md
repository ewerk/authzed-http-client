# 👩‍💻Building locally

The full automation flow is not yet clear. For the moment, a simple shell script is provided to
build the client(s) locally using a Docker based stack.

```bash
# run the client generation locally
# make sure you run the command from the project root directory
./src/local-builds/generate.sh
```

> ℹ️ The local build approach is main intention is to support local dev and testing. The _real_ source of truth are the GitHub actions.
